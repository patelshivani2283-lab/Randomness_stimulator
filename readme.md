# ⭐ **VIVA QUESTIONS + Answers (Most Asked)**



# **1. Basic Project Questions**

### **Q1. What is the main purpose of your project?**
**A:** The purpose of my project is to generate random numbers, visualize them using histograms, and create statistical reports. This helps understand patterns, behavior, and properties of different probability distributions.


### **Q2. Why did you choose this project?**
**A:** I chose it because randomness is used in simulations, statistics, AI, games, and cryptography. This project helps understand how random data behaves in real life.


### **Q3. What are the main features of your project?**
* Random number generation
* Support for 4 major distributions
* Automatic CSV output
* Statistical summary report
* Histogram visualization
* Seed-based reproducibility



# **2. Randomness & Statistics Questions**

### **Q4. What is randomness?**
**A:** Randomness means events occur without any predictable pattern.



### **Q5. What is a distribution?**
**A:** A distribution describes how values are spread in a dataset.



### **Q6. List the distributions used in your project.**
* Uniform
* Normal (Gaussian)
* Binomial
* Poisson



### **Q7. What is mean, median, and mode?**
* **Mean:** average
* **Median:** middle value
* **Mode:** most frequent value



### **Q8. What does variance and standard deviation show?**
**A:**
Both show how spread out the data is.
Standard deviation is the square root of variance.



### **Q9. What is histogram?**
**A:** A histogram displays frequency of numeric data in bars.



# **3. Questions About Each Distribution**

### **Q10. What is Uniform distribution?**
**A:** All values have equal probability of occurring.



### **Q11. What is Normal distribution?**
**A:** Bell-shaped curve where data clusters around the mean.



### **Q12. What is Binomial distribution?**
**A:** It counts the number of successes in *n* trials with probability *p*.



### **Q13. What is Poisson distribution?**
**A:** Measures the number of events occurring in a fixed interval (like calls per minute).



# **4. Python & Coding Viva**

### **Q14. Why did you use NumPy?**
**A:** NumPy generates random numbers fast and efficiently.



### **Q15. Why use Pandas?**
**A:** Pandas helps store data in DataFrame and save CSV files.



### **Q16. Why did you use Matplotlib?**
**A:** To plot histograms for visual analysis.



### **Q17. What does `scipy.stats.mode()` do?**
**A:** It calculates the mode of the data.



### **Q18. What is a seed? Why use it?**
**A:** Seed ensures the same random output each time → reproducibility.



### **Q19. Why use functions instead of writing code in one block?**
* Reusability
* Cleaner structure
* Easy debugging



### **Q20. What is the purpose of `os.makedirs()`?**
**A:** To create folders automatically if they don't exist.


### **Q21. Why do we save outputs in CSV?**

**A:** CSV is universal, easy to open, and perfect for data analysis



# **5. Project Workflow Viva**

### **Q22. Explain your project workflow.
1. User selects distribution
2. Generator function creates random data
3. Data saved as CSV
4. Statistics computed
5. Histogram generated
6. Report saved



### **Q23. How does your menu work?**
**A:** It takes user input, maps it to distribution, asks for parameters, then calls the simulation function.



### **Q24. What is the role of `run_simulation()`?**
* Generates random array
* Saves CSV
* Computes statistics
* Creates histogram
* Returns file paths



### **Q25. Why separate code into functions?**
**A:** To increase modularity and readability.



# **6. Error & Edge Case Viva**

### **Q26. What if user enters invalid input?**
I handle it using `try-except`.
The menu keeps asking until valid input is given.



### **Q27. What if sigma is negative?**
I validate input so sigma cannot be less than zero.


### **Q28. What if uniform high < low?**
The values are swapped automatically.


### **Q29. What if count = 0?**
Count must be >=1 (handled in input validation).



# **7. Advanced Viva Questions**

### **Q30. Why did you choose histogram instead of line chart?**
Distributions show frequency, which histograms represent better.


### **Q31. What are applications of randomness simulator?**
* AI and machine learning
* Financial simulations
* Game development
* Scientific experiments
* Risk analysis


### **Q32. What is reproducibility and why is it important?**
Being able to recreate the same results is important for testing and debugging.


### **Q33. What is λ (lambda) in Poisson?**
Mean rate of occurrences.
